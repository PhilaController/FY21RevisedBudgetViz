      <p>
        <span class="label">General Fund</span>: The General Fund is the City’s
        main operating fund. It funds core municipal functions and is primarily
        financed through local tax revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="label">Fiscal Year</span>: The City’s fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="label">Five Year Plan</span>: An annual financial plan including revenue and
        spending projections for the next five fiscal years. The City issues a new
        Five Year Plan each year, and PICA is required to review the plan
        annually.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="label">Budget Making Process</span>: The mayor typically
        delivers the annual budget to City Council in March. This budget
        includes the Operating budget, Capital budget, and the Five Year
        Financial Plan. In the weeks following the mayor’s budget address,
        Council deliberates on the budget by holding public hearings, which
        include the testimonies of City departments. Council must approve the
        budget before the fiscal year ends on June 30th, at which point the Five
        Year Plan is sent to PICA for final approval.

            Pennsylvania Intergovernmental Cooperation Authority
            (PICA)
          </a>
        </span>: PICA is an oversight board for the City of Philadelphia created
        by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1991 to provide financial
        assistance to the City. Originally, PICA issued bonds to Philadelphia,
        but this power has since expired. To pay back the debt on the bonds
        issued to the City, PICA collects a 1.5% tax on the wages and earnings
        of Philadelphia residents (included in the residential wage tax rate of
        3.8712%). The portion of the PICA tax revenue that is not used for debt
        service is remitted to the City and managed in the PICA City Account.
        PICA’s oversight duties include the annual review of the City’s Five
        Year Plan.

          >Wage and Earnings Tax</a>
        </span>: The Wage and Earnings Tax is a tax on salaries, wages,
        commissions, and other compensation, with different rates for
        Philadelphia residents and non-residents who work in the city. Wage Tax
        payments are made by employers on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis
        throughout the year. The revised Five Year Plan proposes increases to
        the non-resident portion of the wage tax and delays planned reductions
        to the resident portion of the Wage Tax through FY23. The FY20 and FY21
        Wage Tax rates for residents and non-residents are given in the table
        below.
